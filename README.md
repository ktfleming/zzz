This is an earlier attempt at what eventually became [rhc](https://github.com/ktfleming/rhc). Compared to rhc, it featured more of a TUI approach with forms, in-app request definition management, navigation, etc. It worked, but it wasn't as quick and intuitive to use as I would have liked. With rhc, I rethought the approach to make it focused only on request selection/dispatch, with the actual request definition management left up to the user.

This code should still compile and run with Stack, but there aren't any binaries available.
